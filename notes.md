Artist's Ally is a vibrant platform tailored specifically for self-taught artists. It aims to empower artists to showcase their talent, connect with fellow creators, and explore a wealth of artistic inspiration.

It offers the following functionalities:

1. Artist Profiles:

Each artist can create a personalized profile that will showcase their portfolio of created paintings.

2. Painting Management:

Artists can edit and update artworks as their portfolio grows. For example, they may wish to increase the price of a painting they are selling, or change its title or description - this is absolutely possible. 

Artists can effortlessly delete artworks that no longer represent their artistic vision. Or, in a case a painting is no longer available for sale (great, this means that it was most likely sold), it can be deleted from the profile.

3. Inspiration and Exploration:

Explore and admire the creations of other artists within the community.
Discover new techniques, styles, and mediums through the diverse range of artworks on display.
Find inspiration in the stories and journeys shared by fellow self-taught artists.

I invite you all to join Artist's Ally today!
